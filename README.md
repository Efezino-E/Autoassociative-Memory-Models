This repository is a project on creating a Universal Hopfiled Network according to framework described by Beren et al (2022)
on the paper titled "Universal Hopfield Network: A General Framework for Single-Shot Associative Memory Models"

The aim of this project is to eventually create a package
At the current moment, a python file containing the class is being used instead of a class and updated as it is applied and tested.

Upon complete application and proof of concepts from basic applications (which is still underway), 
the package will be published and then updated accordingly on more tests and applications

This readme file will be updated as the project progresses
